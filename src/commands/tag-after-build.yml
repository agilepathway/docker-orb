description: Tag a Docker image after it has been built

parameters:

  step-name:
    type: string
    default: Docker tag
    description: Specify a custom step name for this command, if desired

  image:
    type: string
    default: $IMAGE_NAME
    description: >
      Name of image to build, defaults to the value of
      the $IMAGE_NAME variable (which is set during the
      publish job to be whatever was set as the image
      name there)

  tag:
    type: string
    description: >
      Comma-separated list of image tags to be added after
      the docker image has been built (e.g. version numbers
      of software installed on the image, which can only be
      known after building the image, not before)

steps:
  - run:
      name: <<parameters.step-name>>
      command: |
        # set the tag as a variable because if we just use parameters.tag in the loop,
        # then any errors will be suppressed
        dockerTags="<< parameters.tag >>"
        IFS="," read -ra DOCKER_TAGS \<<< "$dockerTags"
        for tag in "${DOCKER_TAGS[@]}"; do
          docker tag <<parameters.image>> <<parameters.image>>:${tag}
        done
